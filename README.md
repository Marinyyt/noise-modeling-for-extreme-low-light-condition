# noise-modeling-for-extreme-low-light-condition

## Background
This repository provides the code for training a denoised neural network with the synthetic data under extreme-low light environment and the corresponding testing code for evaluating the well-trained network on the realistic data.  The detailed illustration is described in the paper:

《A Novel Noise Formation Model for Dark Scene》

In addition, it also provides some analysis codes to explore on the real noise distribution and some of the useful papers/tutorials that I read during my internship.
